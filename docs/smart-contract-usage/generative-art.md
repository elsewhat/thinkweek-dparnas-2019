# Generative art

## Autoglyphs - 2019?

## Art blocks
"Art Blocks is a generative art platform that allows collectors to mint tokens without knowing what they will get ahead of time. The artist writes a code that is plugged into the platform, which will generate different combinations of the variables at random. The creator, Snowfro, came up with the idea when he was claiming CryptoPunks back in 2017, and he thought it was unfair that he got to claim a bunch of zombies. Over the next few years, he sold over 20 zombies to fund the development of Art Blocks." - from [Meet Art Blocks: One of the Most Unique Platforms in NFTs Right Now](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/art/art-blocks-nft-platform-to-know)
