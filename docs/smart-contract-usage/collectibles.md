## Mooncats
"This project is an exploration of the ability to release tradable collectibles and record their ownership on the Ethereum blockchain.
Instead of selling all of the MoonCats as the contract owner or giving all of the MoonCats away, we have given people the opportunity to find MoonCats by using their computers to generate a seed that hashes to an available and unique catId. This seed can then be submitted to the contract to rescue the corresponding MoonCat. The resulting MoonCat is initially owned by the Ethereum address that submitted it.

An off chain algorithm, the MD5 checksum of which is stored in the contract, parses the catId into its unique corresponding MoonCat image. This allows you to verify that your catId corresponds to your MoonCat image. " - from [MoonCatRescue](https://mooncatrescue.com/info.html)
