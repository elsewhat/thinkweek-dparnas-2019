# Smart contract usage
Decentralized applications using smart contracts on the blockchain as a backend have a tremendous momentum. 
Multiple use case has already been discovered, but it's still early days and has a significant risk involved. 

Early adopters need to be extra careful with scams, unintentional errors in smart contracts, high transaction cost and so on. 

During my ThinkWeek I've looked into various existing use cases that show potential.

## Getting started as a user
It may seems daunting at first to get started as user of smart contract projects. 
There definitively will be innovation on simplifying the user setup, but for technical adapt person it's quite straightforward already today

### Step 1: Get yourself a hardware wallet
To me, a hardware wallet is a must if you are going to own items of significant value. 
It mitigates risk related to virus, keyloggers, rogue extension as the transaction signing is done on the device
Recommend the [Trezor One](https://shop.trezor.io/product/trezor-one-black) which cost approximately 50 euros.


### Step 2: Acquire some ETH
Almost all smart contract projects today are running on the Ethereum blockchain, so to interact you need to own the currency ETH. 

A simple way of acquiring ETH in Norway is to use the [MiraiEx exchange](https://miraiex.com/). It's registered with the Norwegian Finanstilsynet, you log on with [Vipps](https://www.vipps.no/) and has simple support moving NOK from norwegian banks. Please don't aquire more ETH than you can afford to lose.

Once you have acquired some ETH in MiraiEx, you need to move it to your hardware wallet. To do this, you create an Ethereum account on your hardware wallet and supply this address to a withdrawl transaction from MiraiEx.

### Step 3: Install MetaMask
[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) has become the defacto crypto wallet. Whenever you navigate to a site which sells smart contract projects, it will typically ask you to log on to MetaMask and this will represent your user.

You will then connect your hardware wallet as an account in Metamask. The instructions are found in [How to connect a Trazor or Ledger Hardware Wallet](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020394612-How-to-connect-a-Trezor-or-Ledger-Hardware-Wallet).

### Step 4: Log in to marketplace
[https://opensea.io/](Opensea) is the dominant marketplace and will allow trade regardless of where the NFT token was initially created. 

### Step 5: Stay up to date
Twitter and Discord are the two main channels to keep any eye out for what is happening in the space. Each project typically has their own discord environment where there is alot of activity between collectors.
