# Day 1 - 31.05


## Topic of toyday - World class APIs
Day 3 was dedicated as a research day for API related topics. The plan was not write any content.

Watched Developer Empathy from Nordic APIs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4bpS1Skgvk
Adam DuVander presented there and had some interesting points. I therefore started reading his book ["Developer Marketing does not exist"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/173702960X/)
