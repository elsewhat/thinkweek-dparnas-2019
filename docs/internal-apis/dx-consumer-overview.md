# Developer experience for API Consumer

In [Adam DuVander](https://twitter.com/adamd)  book ["Developer Marketing does not exist"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/173702960X/) this figure caught my attention.

He writes the following to explain the figure:
"The first impression colors how a developer approaches your company. Next, once a developer has chosen to give you a shot comes that initial experience, the thing you might mistakenly call the developer experience. While getting started is important, it's only the start. You next need to help a developer become successful, which will give them a higher likelihood of becoming a customer. Finally, they'll still need a great ongoing developer experience. Their last visit-as in the most recent- becomes important."

This has several similarities on what in the UX community is refered to as a [Journey map](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/) and is a powerful tool to understanding the mindset of a person and their actions over time.
