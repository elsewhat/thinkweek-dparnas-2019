# Think Week 2020 for Dagfinn Parnas
For 2020, I will set aside a Think Week in order to reflect and deep dive into work topics important for me personally. 
I prioritize this instead of participating in conferences or attending courses.

Overview: 
* [Planning of Think Week](https://github.com/elsewhat/thinkweek-dparnas-2020/milestone/1)
* [Topic 1: World-class open APIs - Design, implement, operate and measure the effect](https://github.com/elsewhat/thinkweek-dparnas-2020/milestone/2)
* [Topic 2: Future of Work](https://github.com/elsewhat/thinkweek-dparnas-2020/milestone/3)
* Likely 1-2 more topics to focus
